# Nonlinear modelling

## Examples of nonlinear models

## The cost function

## Finding optimal parameters

1. How to go about this (find approximate parameter values by hand, use R optimizer to refine, always make a drawing to confirm that initial estimates are correct, add example to show that blindly trusting the optimizer can lead to wrong results)
2. Short discussion of optimization methods (gradient descent, nelder-mead, brute-force, stochastic). Maybe defer to appendix
3. Worked out example: Streater Phelps

## Sensitivity analysis

## Uncertainty analysis

Not sure of whether to include this. Is there a practical on this?

## Model selection

## Optimal experiment design
